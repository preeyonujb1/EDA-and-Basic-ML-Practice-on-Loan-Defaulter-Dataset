# EDA-and-Basic-ML-Practice-on-Loan-Defaulter-Dataset
Simple EDA and Basic ML Algorithms such as XGBoost and Logistic Regression used, to predict a loan defaulter.

Here is list of things I have tried implementing on this dataset:

1) Feature Correlation : To check if any feature is correlated.
2) Finding feature importance using random forest classifier. 
3) Observing distributions for various features.
4) Individually observing various facets of the features, like finding any hidden pattern in those features.
5) Dropping unimportant features and preparing the test and train sets.
6) Implementing XGBoost and Logistic Regression to see how well it performs. The parameters for both these algorithms has been chosen using GridSearchCV.

Some of the things which I will be implementing in the near future:
1) Improving the quality of EDA
2) Trying out more ML classification Algorithms
3) Trying out some sort of Feature Engineering
4) Ensembling the models
5) Filling missing data instead of removing it

Any kind of feedback, detailed or vague would be appreciated. Suggestions on the smallest of things, such as increasing efficiency in creating the train-test split, or a better way of implementing some basic feature will help me.

Thank you.
